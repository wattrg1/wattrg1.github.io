<h3>3/8 - 13/8</h3>
<div id="thanks">
	<P>
    The first couple weeks prior to Sprint 1 was spent learning about the Agile Manifesto,
SCRUM, and how to use Laravel.<br><br>
What I did in Sprint 1:<br><br>
We set up a messenger group so we would be able to properly communicate
with each other outside of Polytech.<br><br>
Came up with use cases after the client gave a rough outline of what kind of
website he wanted (Video Games High-Score Ranking site similar to <a href="http://mariadb.ict.op.ac.nz/~se19s2_02/op-stats-mikrosoft/Software%20Engineering%20Project/public/">this</a>). Some
of the use cases included:<br>
As a user I want to see games popular in my community so I can play with
more friends<br>
As a user I want to be able to log out of my account to maintain account
security<br>
As a user I want to access the site on my mobile device so I can check my
stats on the go<br>
As a user I want to be able to view the top groups to compare my own<br>
As a user I want to easily navigate the site for ease of use<br>
As a user I want to be able to view all users who have registered to the
website to find new challenges and friends<br>
As a user I want to be able to ban/report inappropriate content to get the
community safe<br>
As a user I want to be able to view the highest ranked players to compare
myself for context<br>
As a user I want to be able to create/join a group to keep track of my
online friends<br>
As a user I want to create/edit my personal profile so that I can personally
group all my scores<br>
As a user I want to add/edit scores to track my skills against other players<br>
As a user I want to view high scores so that I track my skills against other
players<br>
As a user I want to be able to log in to my account to maintain account
security<br>
As a user I want an aesthetic page to use so I enjoy my time on it more<br>
As a user I want to add new games for users to add scores on so we can
expand the gaming community.<br><br>
We were all still learning how to effectively use Laravel, so we spent time getting
each personâ€™s environment set up as well as setting up GitHub with branches
and Kanban boards for each Sprint.<br><br>
One of the most useful things during this sprint was when my group member,
Phil, posted on GitHub the correct set up configurations for the .env file.<br>
  </P>

  <br>
  <p>
    Phil managed to get a very bareboned yet functioning site up and running while
Todd and I worked on learning CRUD.<br><br>
Evidence of Agile Principles:<br>
Satisfy the client through continuous updates and delivery: Was told/shown by the client an idea of the sort of site he wanted.<br>
Deliver working software frequently: Got a barebones site up and running so we were able to test new
implementations.<br>
Face to face conversations during development and at regular intervals, reflect on the team can be more effective: Learnt what SCRUM was and set up a SCRUM leader for the first sprint.
