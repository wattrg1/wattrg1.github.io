    In this sprint it was mostly tidying up issues with the website and making sure
everything worked correctly and looked professional. My technical achievement in this
sprint included:<br><br>
Setting the main buttons on the home page so that one of them was clicked by
default. This was a barrier I encountered and to get around this within the time
constraints, the image and texts that should appear when the first button is
clicked was just hardcoded into the welcome page and would change when a
different button is clicked.<br>
Changing the icons for these buttons to look more professional than the
placeholder images that were previously there for testing.<br>
Add a photo and description to go alongside the button for a specific vehicle body
type when clicked.<br>
Overall made the home page look more professional (changing main pixelated
picture).<br><br>
During this sprint we communicated a lot more in the group chat as shown below<br>
Here is our first and only scrum meeting on the chat:<br>

    This is the zoom meeting we had to discuss the issue of making the button clicked on
by default, I knew it was possible to do with radio buttons but was unsure how it worked
with regular buttons. Unfortunately, the group wasn’t able to help.<br>

    We also caught everyone up to speed with what needed to be worked on by looking at
our group’s Kanban board on GitHub.<br>
