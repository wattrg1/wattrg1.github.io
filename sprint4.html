    Although the sprint technically only went for two weeks, the end of it was the last day of
term which meant we were able to work on the project for two extra weeks during the
holidays. My task during this time was to populate the database with cars and to make
the buttons on the home screen more appealing, instead of having just the names for
each vehicle body-type on the buttons, I added pictures, which at a later point, we
decided to change again. There weren’t many challenges/barriers here as it was a
relatively easy workload. The only barrier wasn’t based on the code, but with our
communication mostly only being through messenger, so we decided to organize some
zoom meetings to make sure everyone was up to speed with what was being done and
what needed to be done.<br><br>
Below is a screenshot taken of my group members helping me when I wasn’t sure about
the image field, whether the input should be text or not. Afterwards we checked on the
Kanban for this sprint to make sure everyone knew what they were supposed to be
doing.<br>

    Evindence of Agile: <br> The best designs emerge from self-organizing teams: We all agreed that we needed to ensure the project was on track while we
    were not meeting in classes and the best way to do so was to have a faceto-face conversation (Principle 6 as well).
