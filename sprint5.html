<div id="thanks">
	<P>
		During this sprint there was still some leftover code related to the old games website,
and my job was to completely change every reference from games to cars and get rid of
some other useless code that had been leftover such as the idea of user groups that
had up until then been left in just in case, this stuff was removed to ensure a cleaner,
more professional looking product for the client.<br><br>
What I could have done better:<br>
In retrospect I should have taken on more work and/or organized another
meeting with the client to see what else was needed on the site or what needed
to be worked on.<br><br>
There was not much technical achievement by me in this sprint.
