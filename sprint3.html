    During this sprint I was able to tie user IDs to the addition of games in the database, I
achieved this by using “var_dump” in the code to help me see what all was being sent to
each form by displaying everything on the web page. <br>

    It was also during this Sprint that I decided to set up the Laravel environment on my
home computer as the workload was starting to increase, and I could work on the
project at home if need be. This was a barrier I encountered as it ended up taking
several hours and I ran into multiple problems including an error “Could not find the
driver”. I messaged the group chat for help but ultimately worked it out myself.<br>

    Sprint 3 was where the main goal of the project was changed to be a completely
different site (game high scores to a car sales site) but still use the same base code.
This meant there was no longer a need to tie users to groups which I was struggling
with, and only focus on the link between users and cars/games. This would only be
visual to admins of the site who are able to see the backend.<br>
Below is the Kanban board of sprint 3.5 from GitHub after the project objective was
changed.<br>

    Evindence of Agile: <br> Simplicity, maximizing the amount of work not done: Setting up this environment at home meant for all future sprints I would be
    able to break my work into smaller segments and wouldn’t clump my
    entire workload into only 2 days a week while I was at class.<br>
    Working software is primary measure of success: With such a big change of plans, we had to change the look, wording, and
    dynamic of the website from games to cars before the end of the sprint.<br>
    Welcome changing requirements: This is the main agile principle demonstrated in this sprint as we had to
    find every mention of ‘game’ and change it to ‘car’ to meet the client’s
    needs. We also needed to put the system for groups we had on hold as
    we didn’t know if it would be useful again.<br>
