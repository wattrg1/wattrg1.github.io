<h3>17/8 - 27/8</h3>
<div id="thanks">
	<P>
		For this sprint I was tasked with tying user accounts to certain games and tying user accounts to groups they could be part of, at this point I hadn’t learnt about many to many relationships in my other programming class so it was a big learning curve for me, this task would carry over into the next sprint. 

	At this point, we already had user accounts set up on the site and it was decided that any admin of the site should be able to view which games/groups were added by which user. Prior to this image, the users didn’t have an ID attribute so there was no way of knowing which user was which, this was set to auto-increment so there would be no duplicates.
